## Introduction
Before now, developers were writing code without collaboration and working individually without code review: In 2008,  GitHub was launched as a social network platform to bring developers around the globe to a central place; and this establishment introduced the coming together of techies, programmers, and technologists which create room for interaction, connections, and also allow programmers to build together with their mates around the globe.

In this article,  we will look at the Introduction To  GitHub: and discuss, what GitHub is about, and also talk about Git, GitHub Desktop, GitHub CLI, and selected features on Github.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based graphical interface that allows developers, programmers, and content creators around the globe to store their projects on the cloud-based service; and share resources, collaborate, and keep track of their projects. <br>

## Why GitHub?
GitHub is a centralized platform that allows software developers around the globe; to host their git repository free:  The implementation of GitHub opens the door for effective management of projects.
GitHub has broken the barrier of programmers working alone on a single project and has created an avenue for collaboration and monitoring of changes made by any other developer.

> Note*: GitHub is a community of different stacks of developers around the globe; that come together to network, share knowledge, and collaborate as a team to solve a problem.

## Git vs. GitHub

## Pull Request

## What is Pull Request?

Pull request is a way that GitHub sets aside for the author of a code to share its code with other developers and allow others to review the code before finally merging it to the integration branch and leaving a comment.

## How to Pull Requests from GitHub

Locate a project you want to contribute to,

Then, do the following:

<ol>
<li>Click on Fort</li>
<li>Clone it to your local machine (computer)</li>
<li>Then, make a new branch </li>
<li>Now, push it back to your repo.</li>
<li>Click on compare & pull request button.</li>
<li>Finally, click Create a pull request to open a new pull request.</li>
</ol

<li>Move to the commit by clicking the commit message link given below.</li>
<li>To know which branch the commit is on, look at the label below the commit message.</li>

##  GitHub Desktop vs. GitHub CLI
## What is GitHub Desktop?
GitHub Desktop is a GUI-based application that allows the practices of git and GitHub; web-based activities: such as collaboration and working with git more flexibly. One can connect to an account, create git repositories, monitor changes and commit easily within the interface.

## GitHub CLI
## What is GitHub CLI?
GitHub CLI stands for Command-line tool; it is an open-source tool that enhances the usage of GitHub from your computer’s command line; Anytime you’re working from the command line, you’re using GitHub CLI, and its saves time.
